                 We get introduced to Trevor and more so his childhood where the themes of religion, apartheid, and parenting are dominant. We get to see that Trevor comes from a very religious family where he was raised by women. The theme of parenting is brought up in the way that Patricia would discipline Trevor and also impact values in him to help nurture him into who he is today. Apartheid is brought up by the massive killings between the tribes of the Zulu and Khosa in the country.
                
                Chapter Two
                We delve deeper into Trevor’s early life. We are introduced  to his father Robert who was half-German and half-Swiss, and how Trevor was considered a crime since intermarriage between white people and black people was illegal.<br><br> Patricia took several measures such as having a white woman walk with Trevor while they were out in the streets. His grandmother would not allow him to go outside because if the police saw him they would take him and he would end up in a foster home. The theme of work is brought about because of Patricia’s work as a secretary in a company run by white people. What stands out in this chapter is Patricia taking a risk to have a child with someone from a different race and all the risks she took to raise him at a time when having him was considered a crime.
